READ THIS CAREFULLY — THIS IS THE CORE IDEA OF THE PRODUCT.

My idea is based on very common, day-to-day health problems that people face in real life.

Examples include:
- Vitamin or calcium deficiency
- B12-related symptoms like numbness, vibration, weakness
- Mild fever or viral infection
- Small injuries while playing (scratches, nail wounds, cuts)
- General fatigue or weakness

In real life, for such small issues, people usually do NOT visit a doctor.
Instead, they:
- Search on the internet
- Use past personal experience
- Go to a nearby medical shop and self-medicate

Sometimes this works, but sometimes it leads to wrong medication, delayed care,
or unnecessary risk.

The reason people avoid doctors for small issues is because:
- Doctor visits are costly
- They take time
- They are inconvenient for small problems

The goal of this product is NOT to replace doctors
and NOT to diagnose diseases.

The goal is to MODIFY THE APPROACH of healthcare access.

KEY IDEA:
Create a TRUSTED, EASY, and AFFORDABLE intermediate layer between self-medication
and professional healthcare.

HOW THIS WORKS:

1. The system only deals with SMALL, COMMON, NON-CRITICAL problems.
2. It helps users decide:
   - Is this problem safe to handle with general care?
   - Or should I consult a doctor?
3. It NEVER diagnoses diseases.
4. It NEVER gives prescription-level medical advice.

FEATURE CONCEPT:

- Verified doctors create short educational videos
  (for example: “When numbness is usually harmless”
   or “When you must consult a doctor”).
- This is NOT like YouTube.
  Only professional doctors can upload content.
- Content is categorized by:
  symptom type, purpose, and doctor specialization.
- Doctors are region-based (nearby doctors first).

LIGHT CONSULTATION SUPPORT:

- Doctors may optionally provide a simple FAQ-style chatbot.
- This chatbot:
  - Answers only general, non-critical questions
  - Is strictly limited to doctor-approved responses
  - Must refuse complex or serious medical questions
- For serious or unclear situations, the system must redirect the user
  to a real doctor consultation.

CONSULTATION BOOKING:

- If the user still has doubt, they can:
  - Book an online consultation
  - Or book a physical visit
- Booking is region-based by default
- Users may optionally change region for wider access

VERY IMPORTANT BOUNDARIES:

- No diagnosis
- No disease prediction
- No automated prescription
- No medical AI acting as a doctor

DESIGN PHILOSOPHY:
“Guide people safely, don’t treat them”
“Make doctor access easier, not replace doctors”
