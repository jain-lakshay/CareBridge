You are a senior full-stack engineer and system architect.

I need a COMPLETE, PRODUCTION-READY full stack application called **CareBridge**.

PROBLEM STATEMENT:
People frequently self-medicate for minor health issues such as vitamin deficiencies, mild fever, fatigue, numbness, or small injuries due to high cost, long waiting times, and inconvenience of visiting doctors. This often leads to wrong medication or delayed diagnosis.

CareBridge provides a trusted intermediate layer between self-care and professional healthcare by:
1) Providing safe, non-diagnostic guidance
2) Showing educational content created by verified doctors
3) Allowing users to easily book consultation slots with doctors when required

IMPORTANT MEDICAL RULES:
- The system MUST NOT diagnose diseases
- The system ONLY provides guidance and routes users to professionals
- Chatbots or AI must NEVER answer critical or diagnostic questions
- For serious cases, users must be redirected to consultation booking

--------------------------------------------------
TECH STACK (MANDATORY):

Backend:
- Node.js
- Express.js
- PostgreSQL
- Transactions & concurrency safety

Frontend:
- React.js
- TypeScript
- React Context API
- react-router-dom

--------------------------------------------------
BACKEND REQUIREMENTS:

Entities:
- Users (mock authentication)
- Doctors (name, specialization, region, verified)
- DoctorSlots (date, startTime, endTime, availability)
- Bookings (PENDING, CONFIRMED, FAILED)
- DoctorVideos (educational, doctor-owned)
- SymptomCategories (non-diagnostic)

APIs:
- Create Doctor (Admin)
- Create Slots for Doctor (Admin)
- List Doctors by Region
- List Slots for Doctor
- Book Slot (HIGH CONCURRENCY SAFE)
- Booking Status API

Concurrency Handling (CRITICAL):
- Prevent double booking under high concurrency
- Use PostgreSQL transactions
- Use SELECT … FOR UPDATE
- If multiple users try booking the same slot, only one succeeds
- Others must receive FAILED status

Booking Flow:
AVAILABLE → PENDING → CONFIRMED
PENDING → FAILED (timeout OR conflict)

Bonus:
- Booking expires if PENDING for more than 2 minutes
- Expired booking releases the slot automatically

Project Structure:
- Controller / Service / Repository pattern
- Centralized error handling
- Environment variable configuration
- Ready for production deployment

--------------------------------------------------
FRONTEND REQUIREMENTS:

Pages:
- / → List doctors
- /booking/:doctorId → Slot booking page
- /admin → Admin dashboard

User Flow:
- View doctors
- View slot availability
- Select slot visually
- Book slot
- See booking status updates
- Handle errors gracefully

Admin Flow:
- Create doctor
- Create slots
- View all doctors and slots

UI/UX:
- Slot-based layout (calendar or grid)
- Disabled booked slots
- Loading, empty, and error states
- Clean medical-style UI

State Management:
- React Context API
- AuthContext (mock)
- DoctorContext
- BookingContext

--------------------------------------------------
DELIVERABLES I NEED YOU TO GENERATE:

1) Backend folder structure
2) Frontend folder structure
3) PostgreSQL schema + SQL
4) Backend APIs with full code
5) Frontend React + TypeScript code
6) Concurrency-safe booking logic
7) Booking expiry logic
8) README.md with setup instructions
9) Short system design documentation
10) Code comments explaining decisions

OUTPUT FORMAT:
- Generate FULL FILES (not snippets)
- Use clear file separators (e.g. === server/index.js ===)
- Code must compile and run
- No placeholders like “TODO”
- Clean, well-structured, readable code

ACKNOWLEDGE AND START GENERATING THE PROJECT.
